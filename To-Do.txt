-Transfer Sprite Load feature from Game to Level Maker Load Feature(For Proper Level Reload) i.e. fix SetBackground function to load proper sprite sheet before loading "boxes"
-Replace "addComponent" to all "color" areas of Level Maker
-Create Error Var in Game set to false, which can be made true when sprite sheet fails to load and will make all "Box" color instead of addComponent
-Repeat Above for LevelMaker
